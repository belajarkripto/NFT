### What is NFT?

NFTs are digital files whose unique identity and ownership are verified on a blockchain (digital ledger). NFT does not exchange. NFT's are generally created by uploading a file, such as a digital artwork, to an auction marketplace. This creates a copy of the file, which is recorded as an NFT on a digital ledger. While the digital file itself can be reproduced indefinitely, the NFT representing the digital file is tracked down the blockchain and provides proof of ownership to the purchaser. Blockchains such as Ethereum and Flow each have their own token standards to define their use of NFT.(_Wikipedia_)
